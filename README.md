# UEFI-CPP-headers
Some basic UEFI definitions and symbols exactly as definied by the [UEFI spec](https://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_7.pdf), in the form of C++ headers to be used for writing C++ UEFI applications.

For usage example, see https://github.com/VioletGiraffe/UEFI-Bootloader/blob/master/src/gfx.cpp  

This repo (https://github.com/VioletGiraffe/UEFI-Bootloader/) also contains a compilable Visual Studio project for building a working UEFI bootloader on Windows.
